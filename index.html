    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
      web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
      a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
      tables.

      The title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of
      HTML and its functions.

    <h2>So what is HTML</h2>

    <p>
      HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of
      your content. HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you
      use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the conten to make it appear a
      certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or
      image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
      bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
      content:
    </p>

    />

    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the
        element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle
        brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect
        — in this case where the paragraph begins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening tag,
        except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This
        states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
        Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and
        can lead to strange results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element, which
        in this case, is just text.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
        content together comprise the element.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

      website, it says what content should be on a webpage. An HTML document is
